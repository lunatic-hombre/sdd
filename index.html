		"[At the end of the Fifth Age of man] And then Aidos and Nemesis, with their sweet forms wrapped in white robes, will go from the wide-pathed earth and forsake mankind to join the company of the deathless gods: and bitter sorrows will be left for mortal men, and there will be no help against evil."

	<h2>THE THREE PILLARS OF SHAME</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Hatred of Old Code</li>
		<li>Hatred of New Code</li>
		<li>Hatred of Code to Be</li>
	</ol>
	</div>

	<p>The core tenant of <b>Shame Driven Development (SDD)</b> is that <b>all</b> code is unworthy of its own existence. When you look at what you’ve written, you should be overwhelmed with a desire for self-flagellation. You should ask yourself “What would Mother think of this?,” and the correct answer must be “I should have had an abortion.”</p>

	<p>You will have reached <b>peak shame</b> when, upon looking at your code, you kill yourself to prevent you from doing anymore harm to this world.</p>

	<div class="blurb">
		<h2>CONTINUOUS FAILURE</h2>
		
		<p><b>This</b> is the <b>iron ribbon</b> that binds the <b>3 pillars</b> together in a <b>moebius strip</b> of <a>anti-success</b>. It is <b>very important</b> that no stretch of success lasts too long, or you might stop hating yourself, which is the first step on the <b>path to ruin</b>.</p>

		<p>Followers of the Old Way have often treated the word "continuous" as a synonym for "pretty often", but we chose to abide by the true definition - implying that <b>not a single iota of time can be considered anything less than failure.</b></p>
	</div>

	<h1>Chapter 2: Positively Negative Semantics</h1>

	<p>As the world of misers carries on, our language fades deeper into a dream of artificial niceties.  <b>"No more!"</b> cries the SDD acolyte - for there is no greater evil than to deny oneself of the fruits of pain!  Any measure of what you call "success" is merely a lapse in failure.  "Skill" is just the product of a large tally of errors.  The distinguishing of "good" from "bad" is a coward's folly, and must be remitted from the work of the shame-driven developer.</p>

	<p>Before providing feedback on someone's efforts, please consult the figure below to ensure you are using language that is appropriate for a shame-driven developer.</p>

	<table>
		<thead><th style="width:45%">Inane Positive Phrase</th><th>SDD-Appropriate Replacement</th></thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>Great work! You really knocked that one out of the park!</td>
				<td>Your lack of scrutiny is insulting to our work. Try harder at finding your failures.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>We've had a great quarter! Sales are at an all-time high thanks to everyone's efforts!</td>
				<td>Another terrible financial quarter thanks to you morons. Continue improving upon your mistakes, so that our shareholders may reap the rewards of your labour.</td>

				<td>Have you tried the new cafe on the corner?  Their macchiato is to die for!</td>
				<td>The shit being peddled from the cafe on the corner is less terrible than many other establishments.</td>

				<td>Kill yourself.</td>

	<div class="blurb">
		<h2>RECOGNITION OF FAILURE</h2>

		<p>At the end of each unit of incompetent development (e.g. a sprint) an award show for recognizing team member's failings should be held so that their incompetence will live on forever. This should be highly personalized and insulting so that the bearer never forgets (and thus never repeats) their mistakes.  We call this SDD ritual, the <b>Failure Parade</b>.</p>

		<p><b>Note: </b>This is not to be confused with the dreadful <b>Retrospective</b> of the Old Way, where failure is eschewed for a false sense of hope.  Only through the <b>acceptance of failure</b> can we begin the healing process.</p>
	</div>


	<h1>Chapter 3: Rage</h1>

	<div class="quote-block" style="margin:4.5vh auto; max-width: 400px">
		<div class="quote">
		"Do not go gentle into that good night,<br />
		Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br />
		Rage, rage against the dying of the light."
		</div>
		<div class="reference">Dylan Thomas</div>
	</div>

	<p>Hatred is the central driving force in SDD.  The inward, reflective form of hatred comes in the form of <b>shame</b>, which hones your spirit like a fine instrument.  The outward, explosive form of hatred is <b>rage</b>, which propels you forward like the burning coals of a steam engine.</p>

	<p>Despite our best intentions, legacy code will need to be revisited frequently.  When we find ourselves in a thick mass of garbage, we can feel as though we have become untethered to the realm of reason, lost in a sea of shit.  During these times, our wrath can be a beacon of mercy against despair.  <i>Let rage be your guide and you will become <b>invincible</b>.</i></p>
