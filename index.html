	<h2>THE THREE PILLARS OF <b>SHAME</b></h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Hatred of Old Code</li>
		<li>Hatred of New Code</li>
		<li>Hatred of Code to Be</li>
	</ol>

	<p>The most important part of SDD is to be disgusted by your project’s code. When you look at what you’ve written, you should want to punch yourself in the face. When you write code, you should ask yourself “What would Mother think of this?” and then answer “I should have had an abortion”.</p>

	<p>You will have reached peak shame when, upon looking at your code, you kill yourself to prevent you from doing anymore harm to this world.</p>

	<h2>CONTINUOUS FAILURE</h2>

	<p>This is the iron ribbon that binds the 3 pillars together in a moebius strip of anti-success. It is very important that no stretch of success lasts too long, or you might stop hating yourself, which is the first step on the path to ruin.</p>

	<h1>Chapter 2: Positively Negative Semantics</h1>

	There is no "good", only a deficiency in failure.

	<h2>THE RECOGNITION OF FAILURE</h2>

	<p>At the end of each unit of incompetent development (eg, a sprint) an award show for recognizing team member's failings should be held so that their incompetence will live on forever. This should be highly personalized and insulting so that the bearer never forgets - and thus never repeats - their mistake.</p>
